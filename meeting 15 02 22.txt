Meeting 15 02 22 - DR Ed

We managed to cast a full scrren image with the detected object.
We worked on the precision.


TO DO:

- find out if the distortion of the projector help for the calibration, see error rate (arround 74 here)
- Try making a live depth image/object pointing
- Cleaning up the code
