Augmented Stacking V 1.0


Augmented Stacking is an augmented system designed to guide unexperienced users through the stacking of complex and irregular 
geometries. This digital fabrication system was applied to the assembly of one layer of half-timber dry-stone wall. Augmented 
Stacking is composed of two components: the stacking algorithm (which calculates the pose for each stone or irregular object 
feeded to the system) and the augmented pipeline to display the information.
